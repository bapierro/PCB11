Stereoscopic images from SYNS dataset (© October 2016 SYNS Dataset, https://syns.soton.ac.uk/)

Resolution 35% of the original (about 2115 x 1408 pixels)
Mean luminance set to 37.8 cd/m2

Luminance modification was implemented using calibration data,
so that the actual mean luminance of the projected images was the given 37.8 cd/m2.
Also gamma correction was done, but since the projector was perfectly linear, it was actually unnecessary.
